My Github History:
My previous GitHub account was williamdev (it is still on GitHub)
I have abandoned it in place of a more professional account.
I have been on GitHub for 5 years and counting, and I have been programming every once and a while for the same amount of time.
But recently I am getting back into programming regularly and I have goals to meet regarding web development, so it would
be helpful if someone could team up with me to work on a web scraper google search hybrid project I have, just check my projects tab!
